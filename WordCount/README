Basic running of a WordCount program - MapReduce implementation.
We analyze this case and learn more about how MapReduce works.

First we run this on our local Hadoop distribution (1.2.1), and then we complement this with running it on the AWS-EMR-S3.
We use 1 Master 2 Worker configuration (With medium machines)

I have included a Report, where I have mentioned all my findings in brief.
